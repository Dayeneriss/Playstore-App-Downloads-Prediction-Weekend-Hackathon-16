The smartphone revolution started less than 2 decades ago with   the evolution of technologies like touch screen and advanced micro chips that could outmatch the processing capacities of  even some of the Computers at that time. 

Android as a handset operation system played a major part in what we call the smartphone revolution with more than 2 billion active users a month worldwide. What makes Android popular is not just its aesthetics or performance but the millions of applications or softwares that are available for the platform free of cost or paid, enterprise or consumer.

Android Application development is a demanding skill and every business has found the necessity to establish its presence in the market by having its own application made available to users.

In this hackathon, i must foresee the success of an android application by building an ML model that can predict the popularity of an application based on certain factors.
For this work, i just wanted to test Pycaret Library...
